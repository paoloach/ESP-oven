# ESP-oven
A ESP8266 base controller for an oven

My first project using a ESP8266 IOT microcontroller (an ESP-07)

Aim of this project is controlling the temperature of a little oven in order to
maintain it stable.

The setting of the temperature is made by a rest service.

The temperature is read by a thermocouple and the MAX6675.
